## Delete link

If the target file for the deleted link is unreferenced (i.e. orphaned) the prompt to delete the file is displayed.

Configure this feature in the plugin settings:

![delete unreferenced link target on delete link](/docs/img/delete-unreferenced-link-target-on-delete-link-setting.png)
